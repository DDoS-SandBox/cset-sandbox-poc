# InputOrganizer

This is a proof of concept (PoC) implementation which we hacked together,
we plan to cleanup the codebase and connect with other components in DDoS SandBox soon.

Read `main.sh` to learn how to run this code. 
The PoC assumes that you have access to a sFlow feed.
You can also create an sFlow feed using an open vswitch.

This PoC only generates two files:
    * an inferred AS-level topology
    * the prefixes that belong to each AS

Software we used in InputOrganizer:
    * pyasn, https://pypi.org/project/pyasn/, to read BGP dumps.
    * asTopology (only binary is provided at this point) to print all possible AS-level paths from one as to another

Public datasets in InputOrganizer:
    * ip2asn-v4.tsv, https://iptoasn.com/
    * BGP dumps from RouteViews, http://www.routeviews.org.  E.g., rib.20200518.0000.ipasn_db in data folder is processed by pyasn.
    * CAIDA AS relationships, https://www.caida.org/data/as-relationships/,  E.g., 20200101.as-rel.txt.bz2 in data folder
